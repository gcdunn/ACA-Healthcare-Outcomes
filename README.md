### \#healthcare: How Medicaid expansion affects healthcare access in the United States
- How do the ACA and Medicaid expansion affect healthcare access at the state level?
- Does the state-level implementation of the ACA and Medicaid expansion affect how people feel about healthcare in their home state?

#### Overview
One of the major goals of The Affordable Care Act was to close the coverage gap through Medicaid expansion. A Supreme Court decision in 2012 made expansion optional at the state level. Fourteen states that had no previous existing Medicaid expansion program (e.g. a waiver) began Medicaid expansion in January 2014. Sixteen states sis not expand Medicaid through 2017. The remaining states had either an existing waiver program or adopted Medicaid expansion later. The purpose this project is to explore the differences between the first two groups: states that did or did not expand Medicaid in 2014.
